## Welcome

Welcome to the API documentation for Feedbase. There are two different API's available: 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Public API">
    The public API is used to access public project data. This mainly includes data that is available on your public hub.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project API">
    The project API is used to access private project data. There are two different scopes for the project API:
    - Public scope should be used for our [Typescript SDK]('/sdk-reference')
    - Full Access scope is used to access project data and manage project settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Create a new API key

To access the [Project API](/api-reference/endpoint/project/), you need to provide an API key. You can create a new API key with the necessary scopes by clicking below.

## Authentication

All project endpoints are protected and require a valid API key. You can provide the API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.feedbase.app/v1', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer fb_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  },
})
```
