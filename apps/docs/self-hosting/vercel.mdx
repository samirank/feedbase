## Create a new Supabase project

<Tip> You can also self-host Supabase on your own infrastructure. [Learn more](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting).</Tip>

You'll need a Supabase account to get started. [Sign up](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in) if you don't have one already.

Once you've signed up, create a new project. You can do this by clicking on the "New Project" button or by following [this link](https://supabase.com/dashboard/new/_).

### Migrate your database

Once you've created a new project, you'll need to migrate your database. You can do this the following ways:

<Accordion title="Using Supafork (Recommended)">
    Click [here](https://supafork.com/new?repository_url=https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase) and follow the instructions to fork the Feedbase repository and migrate your database automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using the Supabase CLI">
    For this method, you'll need to install the Supabase CLI. View the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-cli).

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Clone the Feedbase repository">
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase.git && cd feedbase
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Login to Supabase">
            ```bash
            supabase login
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Link your project">
            ```bash
            supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
            ```

            You can find your project ID in the URL of your Supabase project dashboard or via runnning `supabase projects list`.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Run the migrations">
            ```bash
            supabase db push
            ```
        </Step>
    </Steps>

    If everything went successful, you should be able to see a populated database in your Supabase dashboard.

</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Manually using the SQL Editor">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Go to your Project's SQL Editor">
            Click on the SQL tab in your project dashboard or follow [this link](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new).
        </Step>
        <Step title="Run the migrations">
            Copy and paste all the contents of each file in the [`supabase/migrations`](https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase/tree/main/supabase/migrations) folder of the Feedbase repository into the SQL editor and run them.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Verify the migrations">
            If everything went successful, you should be able to see a populated database in your Supabase dashboard.
        </Step>
    </Steps>
</Accordion>

### Configure Supabase Authentication

Once you've migrated your database, head over to the [Url Configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#3-configure-redirect-uri) settings and add the following site and redirect URLs:

Site URL: `https://<your-domain>.com`

Redirect URLs: `https://**.<your-domain>.com/**`

## Prepare your environment variables

Once you've migrated your database, you'll need to prepare all necessary environment variables for the next step. 

You can find a list of all environment variables and where to find them [here](https://github.com/chroxify/feedbase/blob/main/.env.example).

### For hosting on a subdomain

<Tip>This is genuinely recommended if you already host a landing page on your root domain (e.g. `https://your-domain.com`).</Tip>

If you're planning hosting Feedbase on a subdomain, meaning your Feedbase instance (admin dashboard) will be accessible at `https://<subdomain>.your-domain.com`, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `SUBDOMAIN_HOSTING`: Set this to `true`
- `DASHBOARD_SUBDOMAIN`: Set this to the subdomain the **Feedbase dashboard** (**NOT** the public hubs, those have to be handled via custom domains in the dashboard) will be hosted on (e.g. `feedbase`)
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_WHITELIST`: A comma separated list of custom domains with the same root domain as the one you are hosting on. This is used to whitelist custom domains for the public hubs. For example, if you are hosting on `feedbase.your-domain.com`, you can add `feedback.your-domain.com` and `feedback2.your-domain.com` to the list and then assign them to you're project in the Feedbase dashboard.

## Deploy to Vercel

Finally, you can deploy your Feedbase instance to Vercel by following the instructions [here](https://feedbase.app/deploy-vercel).

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://feedbase.app/discord) or open an issue on the [Feedbase repository](https://feedbase.app/github). 

### Common issues

#### Vercel deployment fails with `Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed`

This error occurs due to the monorepo structure of the Feedbase repository. To fix this, head over to your Project Settings > General and set the "Root Directory" to `apps/web`.

#### Deployment page shows `404: NOT_FOUND` Vercel error

This usually occurs when the Build and Deployment settinsg are misconfigured. To fix this, head over to your Project Settings > General and select the "Framework Preset" to "Next.js".

#### Feedbase pages show 404 errors

This is often due to misconfigured subdomain environment variables. Please refer to the [Prepare your environment variables](#prepare-your-environment-variables) section and ensure that all necessary environment variables are set correctly.
